# former

Simple transformer implementation from scratch in pytorch. See http://peterbloem.nl/blog/transformers for an in-depth 
explanation.

# Limitations

The current models are designed to show the simplicity of transformer models and self-attention. As such 
they will not scale as far as the bigger transformers. For that you'll need a number of tricks that 
complicate the code.

All models so far are a single stack of transformer blocks (that is, no encoder/decoder structures). It 
turns out that this simple configuration often works best.
